Problem: 1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products

Intuition:
This problem is straightforward, we only have to filter out the id of rows where
both low_fats and recyclable columns are set to 'Y'

Approach:
Simply extract the rows that meet the condition using WHERE statement

Solution:
SELECT product_id FROM Products
WHERE low_fats='Y' AND recyclable='Y';


Problem: 2356. Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher

Intuition:
This problem needs us to compute the number of "unique" subjects told by each teacher.
When seeing the word "unique", we immediately come up with DISTINCT statement. Also,
because we want to compute for each teacher, we certainly have to use GROUP BY.

Approach:
Firstly, since we have to compute value for each teacher, we use `GROUP BY teacher_id`.
Next, as we can generate the unique subjects by `DISTINCT subject_id`. Then, we compute
the number by `COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id)`

Solution:
SELECT teacher_id, COUNT(distinct subject_id) as cnt FROM Teacher
GROUP BY teacher_id;


Problem: 1741. Find Total Time Spent by Each Employee

Intuition:
This problem needs us to compute the total time each employee spent in the office for 
each day. And when it comes to `each`, we immediately come up with GROUP BY statement.
And for total, we could use SUM.

Approach:
Firstly, as we have to compute based on employee and date, so we have to use `GROUP BY emp_id, event_day`.
Next, we can directly use aggregate function SUM as `SUM(out_time-in_time)`

Solution:
SELECT event_day as day, emp_id, SUM(out_time-in_time) as total_time FROM Employees
GROUP BY emp_id, event_day;


Problem: 1693. Daily Leads and Partners

Intuition: 
This problem needs us to compute the unique leads and partners for each date of each make
name. Surely, we come up with DISTINCT, GROUP BY, COUNT statements.

Approach:
Firstly, as we have to compute based on date and make name, we use `GROUP BY date_id, make_name`.
Next, we can filter out distinct valus of leads and partners using `DISTINCT lead_id` and 
`DISTINCT partner_id`. Eventually, we make use of aggregate function COUNT as `COUNT(DISTINCT lead_id)`
and `COUNT(DISTINCT partner_id)` to compute the results.

Solution:
SELECT date_id, make_name, COUNT(distinct lead_id) as unique_leads, COUNT(distinct partner_id) as unique_partners FROM DailySales
GROUP BY date_id, make_name


Problem: 1393. Capital Gain/Loss

Intuition:
This problem needs us to compute the total gain/loss for each stock. So we must have to separate 
buy operation and sell operation. Also, because we have to compute each stock respectively, we
have to use GROUP BY.

Approach:
One of the important thing to notice is that when computing total gain/loss, we don't have to care
about the order of trading under this circumstances. So the strategy becomes: total sell price - 
total sell price. Firstly, we gather the total sell price for each stock using 

	SELECT stock_name, SUM(price) as sell_total FROM Stocks
	WHERE operation='Sell'
	GROUP BY stock_name, operation

This would serve as a subquery. Next we do the same thing for total buy price

	SELECT stock_name, sum(price) as buy_total FROM Stocks
	WHERE operation='Buy'
	GROUP BY stock_name, operation
	
Once we have these two queries, we can join them and compute sell_total-buy_total

Solution:
SELECT s.stock_name, s.sell_total-SUM(price) as capital_gain_loss FROM Stocks as b
	INNER JOIN (
		SELECT stock_name, SUM(price) as sell_total FROM Stocks
		WHERE operation='Sell'
		GROUP BY stock_name, operation
    ) AS s ON b.stock_name = s.stock_name
WHERE operation='Buy'
GROUP BY stock_name, operation;

Modified Solution:
SELECT stock_name, 
	SUM(
		CASE WHEN operation = 'Buy' THEN
			-price
		ELSE
			price
		END
	) AS capital_gain_loss
FROM Stocks
GROUP BY stock_name;

Modified Solution Explained:
In the modified solution, instead of separating the buy and sell operation using subquery,
it makes use of CASE WHEN statement. This have the same results that subquery have, but it
prevents from creating another tables which take more time. And it makes the code more succinct.
